**Carlos Juan Busquiel** was born in 1980 and started playing the guitar at 12, although they also studied the violin at a conservatory. He pursued education in music and English at the **University of Alicante**, working as a teacher for 9 years.

His **interest in instrument making** began when they built an electric violin for personal use, which introduced them to luthiery. Subsequently, he constructed an acoustic violin based on Stradivari's "Kruse" model.
Meeting guitar maker **Rafael López Porras** in Cádiz was pivotal, and he became their first teacher, instilling a passion for crafting Spanish guitars. They then focused exclusively on making guitars and furthered their education by studying with master **José Luis Romanillos**.

This experience helped him develop the concept of the "Spanish guitar" based on traditional designs by **Antonio de Torres**. He had the privilege of studying valuable instruments from historical makers. From this foundation, he developed various guitar models that continue to evolve and gain recognition among guitarists globally.
