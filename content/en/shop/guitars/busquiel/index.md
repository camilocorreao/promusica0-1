Carlos Juan Busquiel was born in 1980 and started playing the guitar at 12, although they also studied the violin at a conservatory. They pursued education in music and English at the University of Alicante, working as a teacher for 9 years. Their interest in instrument making began when they built an electric violin for personal use, which introduced them to luthiery. Subsequently, they constructed an acoustic violin based on Stradivari's "Kruse" model. Meeting guitar maker Rafael López Porras in Cádiz was pivotal, and he became their first teacher, instilling a passion for crafting Spanish guitars. They then focused exclusively on making guitars and furthered their education by studying with master José Luis Romanillos. This experience helped them develop the concept of the "Spanish guitar" based on traditional designs by Antonio de Torres. They had the privilege of studying valuable instruments from historical makers. From this foundation, they developed various guitar models that continue to evolve and gain recognition among guitarists globally.
