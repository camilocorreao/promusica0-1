Hey, guys!

I teach with great passion and I am excited to continue on this path with you.

After a really long break, I finally decided to take my guitar out of the closet and start playing again. And you know what? It was the best decision ever!

In addition to my daily guitar routine, I have also taken on a small project - the proMúsica Studio. I have decided to make my room a real music studio that feels good.

But that's not all! I have used all the knowledge I have acquired in recent years about Linux and the open source movement. That means that I have not only played the guitar, but also installed and configured hardware and software and adapted the acoustics of the room. I have also finally finished this website (but it will never be finished...). It's really cool what you can do with this technology.

So, if you are also passionate musicians or are simply curious about cool projects, get in touch with me.
